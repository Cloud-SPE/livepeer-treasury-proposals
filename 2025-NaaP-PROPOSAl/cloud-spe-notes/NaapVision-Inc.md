# **Livepeer Network-as-a-Product (NAAP) Vision — Summary**

## **1. The Shift: From Streaming Infra → Real-Time AI Video Infrastructure**

Livepeer has spent the past year evolving beyond its origins as a decentralized transcoding network. Guided by the Cascade vision, the ecosystem has reoriented around **real-time AI video**, with strong early validation:

* **Network fees up 3× YoY**, with **72% driven by AI inference**.
* Daydream, Embody, and Agent-based avatar platforms showing compelling real-time AI applications.

Despite this progress, many new builders still struggle to understand Livepeer’s core value:
**Is it a GPU cloud? A streaming infra? An API platform?**

The NAAP vision clarifies this.

## **2. Market Context: “Video” Is Exploding Into a New Category**

Video is no longer a camera feed—AI is generating **dynamic, interactive worlds** in real time:

* Gaming: AI-generated environments
* Real-time video analytics: instant insights and automations
* Avatar and agent generation
* AI-enhanced virtual worlds and style transfer
* Synthetic data generation
* Robotics simulations & world-model training

All of these require **huge amounts of GPU compute + extremely low latency**.

This merges two fields:

* **Real-time AI video**
* **World models**

And Livepeer’s community has deep expertise in **both**: video infrastructure *and* GPU inference.

---

## **3. Core Opportunity: Livepeer Becomes “The AI Infrastructure for Real-Time Video”**

Livepeer is uniquely positioned to offer a vital missing piece of the future AI stack:

> **A global, open, low-latency GPU network specialized for real-time AI video and world-model execution.**

The TAM is enormous—NVIDIA leadership suggests world-model infrastructure could exceed **$100T** in economic impact, touching every industry:

| Industry            | Real-Time AI Opportunity             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Creative            | Style transfer, avatar generation    |
| Gaming              | World generation, interactive scenes |
| Robotics            | Simulation & synthetic data          |
| Data analysis       | Real-time insights                   |
| Monitoring/security | Real-time detection                  |
| Synthetic data      | LLM/world-model training             |

## **4. What the Livepeer Network Must Deliver (the Product Requirements)**

### **1. Workflow Deployment**

Users must be able to deploy **custom real-time AI workflows**, not just run inference on base models.
Workflows = chained models, video pre/post-processing, logic, LLMs.

### **2. Industry-Leading Low Latency**

Livepeer must consistently beat generic GPU clouds on **end-to-end latency** for real-time video inference.

### **3. Cost-Effective Elasticity**

Livepeer’s open marketplace of idle GPUs should allow:

* on-demand scaling
* instant provisioning
* usage-based cost
* price discovery
* lower cost than cloud GPU providers

This replicates the “10× cheaper than cloud” story Livepeer already proved in video transcoding.

### **4. Open, Community-Driven Infrastructure**

* Open source
* Token-aligned incentives
* Permissionless access
* No risk of lock-in or platform rug-pulls
* Builders can own and influence the infrastructure

These three pillars define the network’s **killer value propositions**.

## **5. How Livepeer Gets There: The Four Milestones**

Livepeer must close several gaps before becoming a full NAAP. The roadmap:

### **Milestone 1 — Network MVP**

*Measure what matters.*

* Define and benchmark SLAs
* Establish latency testing frameworks
* Upgrade video + real-time inference pipelines

### **Milestone 2 — Network-as-a-Product**

*Meet SLAs and self-adapt at runtime.*

* Routing, failover, redundancy, selection algorithms
* Real-time price discovery
* Proven low latency on real workloads

### **Milestone 3 — Extensibility**

*Let anyone deploy workflows.*

* Workflow deployment toolkit
* Gateway interfaces
* LPT incentive updates to ensure GPU supply exceeds demand

### **Milestone 4 — Parallel Scalability**

*Run jobs that need multiple GPUs.*

* Multi-GPU orchestration
* Cluster management
* Parallel workflow execution
* World models at scale

Teams across the Foundation, Inc, and SPEs are already executing milestones 1–2.

---

## **6. Blueprint Example: Gaming**

A world-model-powered game does the following:

* Deploys a multi-model, real-time generation workflow
* Needs low-latency inference per player
* Spins up compute elastically as players join
* Wants cost-efficiency and no GPU reservations

Livepeer can deliver this—replicate it across dozens of industries and the network grows 100×.

---

## **7. Go-To-Market: Vertical-Specific Startups**

The likely users:

> **Startups building real-time AI workflows in specific verticals (gaming, robotics, simulation, agents, synthetic data, monitoring, analysis).**

Each startup becomes:

* A design partner
* A source of recurring demand
* A proof point of the network’s performance

The ecosystem may use incentives (grants, credits, investments) to bootstrap these businesses.

Eventually, some will “graduate” and run their own gateways—just like companies moving from Vercel to AWS to their own datacenter.
This **increases network usage**, proving PMF for Livepeer’s infrastructure.

---

## **8. Conclusion: Success = 100× Network Demand**

The NAAP vision states:

Livepeer will win by becoming **the real-time AI + world-model infrastructure layer** powering:

* millions of interactive streams
* low-latency inference
* workflow deployment
* cost-efficient global GPU capacity
* composable APIs and platforms (Daydream, agents, Streamplace, etc.)
* open, community-owned infra

With orchestrators upgrading hardware, SPEs building workflow layers, Daydream proving early demand, and the Foundation optimizing incentives, the network is already on the path.

**Prove the value propositions → 100× demand → real-time AI becomes a Livepeer-powered category.**
