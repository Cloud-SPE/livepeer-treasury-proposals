## Intro

Thank you to everyone who took the time to read the pre-proposal and share thoughtful [feedback](https://github.com/Cloud-SPE/livepeer-treasury-proposals/blob/3361a9019e7a7a678df7a1819ce3b43d7433850c/2025-NaaP-PROPOSAl/PreProposal_Forum_Jan6_2026_feedback.md) in the forum and during the [Watercooler](https://github.com/Cloud-SPE/livepeer-treasury-proposals/blob/3361a9019e7a7a678df7a1819ce3b43d7433850c/2025-NaaP-PROPOSAl/Watercooler_Jan6_2026_feedback.md). We want to acknowledge upfront that many of the concerns raised are valid and important, particularly around scope, cost, architectural complexity, and clarity on how this work will ultimately be used.

This response is intended to clarify intent, address the major points of feedback, and share how we have refined the architecture and framing as a result.

### 1. Building Robust Network Infrastructure

This proposal is intentionally framed as a **network-level capability**, not a one-off dashboard, script, or testing utility.

Treasury-funded work carries an implicit responsibility: anyone must be able to **operate, audit, evolve, and hand off** what is built without fragility. That sets a different bar than demonstrating feasibility with ad-hoc scripts or local tooling. While simpler approaches can validate ideas, they do not meet the requirements for long-term ownership, operator safety, or public accountability.

The goal here is to fund **durable metrics and SLA foundations** that Livepeer can safely rely on over time as part of the Network-as-a-Product (NaaP) initiative—aligned with feedback and direction from both the Foundation and Livepeer, Inc.

Importantly, feasibility is no longer the open question. The harder and more consequential problem is building something the network can depend on *after* feasibility has already been demonstrated.

### 2. Themes from Community Feedback 

Across the discussion, several themes came up repeatedly:

* **Cost vs current network scale**
* **Concern about over-engineering or premature productionization**
* **Risk and viability of Streamr / decentralization**
* **Unclear post-build adoption (“who uses this and how?”)**

We agree these are the right questions to ask. The proposal should not be justified simply because something is “nice to have,” but because it establishes a responsible foundation the network can grow into.

---

### 3. Proposal Updates

Based on feedback from the community and the Foundation, we refined both the scope and architecture of this proposal to reduce risk, dependencies, and cost while preserving the core objectives.

Specifically, we narrowed the problem to a focused, pull-based metrics foundation and removed components causing concern.

The following provides a high level of the adjustments: 

- Removed reliance on decentralized pub/sub infrastructure (Streamr removed).
* Shifted to a **pull-based metrics model**, where gateways and analytics engines retrieve bounded, versioned metrics from orchestrators on a fixed interval
- Orchestrators persist job-level metrics locally (instead of an event log) and expose them for scraping.
- Eliminated the need for global publish permissions or event access controls.
- Service discovery will be handled via existing manual mechanisms.
- Custom jobs (BYOC) may integrate job-level metrics incrementally using documented interfaces.
- Focuses on Video AI workloads and the metrics catalog; transcoding extensions are deferred.


**What did not change:**

* The need for **job-level observability**, not just point-in-time metrics.
* Support for the [requested metrics](https://www.notion.so/livepeer/6914345d128b477d81ee48409a6a9c90?v=fcb9e18cfe2c4746860c58b16a48c8b2) not generated by Livepeer today
* Preserved support for multiple consumers (Gateways, Explorer, researchers).
* The ability to compute **deterministic, reproducible SLA signals**.
* Public APIs and dashboards for transparency.
* Alignment with NaaP milestones and future protocol evolution.

This refinement reflects community input—particularly around risk, complexity, and operator safety—while preserving the core goal of delivering network-level observability rather than isolated metrics.

### 4. MVP does not mean throwaway

A recurring concern was whether this is “too much, too soon.”

We want to be explicit about the distinction we are making:

* **Feature scope is intentionally minimal for MVP**
* **Engineering responsibility is intentionally production-grade from day one**

In other words, we are minimizing *what* is built, not *how responsibly* it is built.

This allows anyone to:

* Rely on the system
* Evolve it incrementally
* Avoid replacing fragile MVPs later at significantly higher cost

### 5. Target Audience

To address questions regarding who the user is of this solution, this proposal responds to needs expressed by the Livepeer Foundation and Livepeer Inc.  The primary audiences for this work are:

#1. **Public Orchestrators**, who provide essential GPU computing capacity to the network by meeting SLAs 

#2 **Gateway Providers**, who provide permission-less O management utility, and the workload management utility.

#3. **Inference service and tooling providers** (such as Daydream), who deploy workloads to the network and manage services for their users, typically through a self-hosted Gateway, and serviceable APIs.

### 6. Responsibly Using the Treasury

We understand concerns around treasury usage and ROI, especially in the current market environment.  Treasury funding must be applied in a strategic manner that results in long term, durable solutions reflecting what consumers would expect of a scalable network.  We focus on delivering solutions that meet production needs and scale, rather than one offs.

The revised scope reflects a deliberate reduction in design surface while preserving the rigor required for long-term use. The requested funding covers analysis, design, testing, documentation, and operation of a public reference implementation. As Doug stated in the above feedback, "establishing this requires significant engineering, testing, and design decisions".

This work is intended to **avoid replacement cost later**, when the network is larger, more visible, and harder to change. Cloud SPE is committing to operate this as a **public reference implementation**, as we have done with prior infrastructure.

We remain open to continued dialogue, provided the resulting system is something that anyone can responsibly depend on.  Cloud SPE has already invested significant upfront design and validation effort into this work and will continue to do so as part of our commitment to delivering a high-quality foundation.

### 7. Closing

We appreciate the candid feedback and the time the community invested in reviewing this proposal. The architectural refinements shared here are a direct result of that engagement.

Our intent is not to optimize for the lowest-effort implementation, but to fund infrastructure that is durable, accountable, and aligned with Livepeer’s long-term direction as a production-grade network. The upcoming proposal revisions will reflect a deliberate narrowing of scope and architecture to reduce risk, complexity, and cost while preserving the core objective: establishing a trustworthy metrics and SLA foundation the network can build on.  It is not intended to solve every future use case, but to deliver a responsible baseline that can be evaluated, adopted, and extended as the network grows.

We welcome further feedback and look forward to moving forward with the community and the Foundation.
